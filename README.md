# 🧾 CV Application (React)

A dynamic CV builder built with React, inspired by [The Odin Project's React curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).  
Users can input personal information, education, and work experience — and see the CV update live as they type, but only preview once they have filled all the form data.
